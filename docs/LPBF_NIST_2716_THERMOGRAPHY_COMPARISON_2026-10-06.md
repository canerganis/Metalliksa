# LPBF NIST mds2-2716 thermography trend comparison (2026-10-06)

**Sensitivity-only trend comparison of the screening kernels against NIST mds2-2716 raw camera-signal metrics; not experimental validation; no temperature conversion; application outputs are screening and unvalidated; nothing was tuned.**

Schema `lpbf-nist-2716-thermography-comparison-1`; implementation fingerprint `11b04b8fa3de1a6b2cf46afb67e6c439f05ca9d0ab2affec92f1e5b239eb3359`; quick mode: False; kernels: rosenthal, eagar-tsai, goldak. Honesty: comparison, not validation; raw camera signal in digital levels (DL); no temperature conversion executed; application outputs are screening and unvalidated; measured and model quantities refer to different isotherms, so only normalised trends and ranks are shown (sensitivity-only); nothing tuned. `experimentalValidation` = false, `opticalOperatorMatched` = false, `modelAcceptance` = false, `nistResidual` = null, `temperatureConversion` = null.

Model inputs: IN718, liquidus 1336 C, absorptivity 0.38 (four_alloy_materials.thermal_props('IN718')['absorptivity_IR'] (assumed constant, not measured)), preheat 20 C (assumption: ambient plate; the NIST plate temperature is not stated in the files in hand), layer 30 um (nominal value passed for a bare plate (no powder), as in tools/lpbf_dataset_comparison.py), hatch 100 um. NIST spot_size (D4s) passed as the kernel beam diameter: for a Gaussian beam D4s equals the 1/e^2 diameter (assumption about the kernel's beam-size convention). flat-plate absorptivity: the optional powder-bed ray tracer is pinned off (bare plate, no powder) via tools/lpbf_dataset_comparison.pin_flat_plate.

Resolved = |ratio - 1| exceeds both the repeat SD of the measured ratio and one measurement quantum (one frame, one frame of travel or one pixel) relative to the baseline. An SD of 0 means the three repeats gave identical integer-frame values, not zero uncertainty. Sign agreement is reported for every row; where the measured change is not resolved it carries no weight.

## Spearman rank over the 7 cases (sensitivity-only)

## Unavailable

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| absolute saturated length / time above threshold vs model liquidus length / dwell | the temperature of the 4095 DL saturation isotherm and of the DL thresholds is unknown (no temperature conversion), so absolute values refer to different isotherms |
| cooling rate (K/s); NIST TSCR, TLCR, PSCR | the camera signal is not converted to temperature, so no K/s exists on the measured side; signal-decay frames are not cooling rates |
| time above melting; NIST TTAM, PTAM | needs T(DL) at solidus/liquidus, i.e. the missing temperature conversion |
| peak temperature | saturated at 4095 DL in every laser-on frame and uncalibrated |
| lpbf_simulation reference transient (enthalpy) backend | not run in v1: the local-history observer is restricted to reference powder-layer runs, the 10 mm bare-plate tracks need the corridor geometry, and the 20 um mesh is about one camera pixel and not converged |
| pad thermography vs kernels | single-track analytic kernels do not represent multi-track heat accumulation; pad camera videos are not analysed in v1 (only the commanded XYPT track table is derived) |
| radiance-temperature bracket (spec Phase 2) | gated: needs a confirmed calibration equation and unit plus a cited emissivity; not implemented |

## Checks

| Check | Result | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A1-input-pins | pass | derived table size and SHA-256 equal the tool pin; manifest raw-input pins equal NERDm v1.3.1 |
| A2-physics-fingerprint | pass | test_lpbf_implementation_fingerprint.py run; recorded fingerprint read from lpbf_implementation_fingerprint.expected |
| A9-no-temperature | pass | measured and comparison blocks scanned for temperature/cooling-rate keys: 0 found (model inputs such as the liquidus are model assumptions, not DL-derived) |
| A10-labels | pass | labels equal LABELS (experimentalValidation false, modelAcceptance false, nistResidual null); every row status in ['sensitivity-only', 'unavailable'] and every unavailable row has a reason |
| A11-determinism | pass | document built twice in this run with the same --generated-at; serialised bytes compared |
| A12-runtime | pass | both builds finished within the 300 s limit; the exact wall time is printed to stdout only, so the record stays byte-deterministic |

## Limits

- Measured and model quantities refer to different isotherms: the camera saturation level and DL thresholds have unknown temperatures; the kernels report the IN718 liquidus of the repo material table.
- Measured lengths use a pixel pitch inferred from the commanded scan speed (README +/-2.5 % k=1); ratios cancel the pitch but the temporal length also carries the commanded speed.
- Kernel inputs are assumptions: absorptivity of record (not measured), ambient preheat, D4s taken as the beam diameter, flat-plate absorption; nothing was tuned to the data.
- Each case has 3 repeats; the measured ratio SD is a first-order repeat-scatter propagation, not an uncertainty budget; Spearman correlations are over 7 cases with no significance claimed.
- Single tracks on bare IN718 only; no powder-bed claim and no pad comparison.
