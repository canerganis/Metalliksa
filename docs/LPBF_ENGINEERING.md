# LPBF engineering simulation — capability and verification record

This implementation is an **unvalidated transient thermal research solver**, with an actual OpenFOAM Foundation 14 backend. It is not a free-surface CFD solver, a process qualification system, or a production-ready LPBF model. The High-Fidelity CFD option currently returns **Screening only** with an explicit reason. Installing OpenFOAM alone does not supply a laser/metal/gas/keyhole solver.

## Architecture and execution

`MeltPool3DCrossSectionLab` → typed HTTP client → `/api/lpbf/jobs` → Node JSON-lines bridge → Python worker in Ubuntu-22.04 WSL → persistent SQLite queue → isolated job process → `blockMesh`, `checkMesh`, `metalliksaThermal` → field extraction → JSON.

The bridge starts one worker lazily. It uses argument arrays, not a browser-provided shell command. The worker accepts only capabilities/submit/get/cancel RPCs. Queue capacity is 16, concurrency is one, and subprocess timeout is configurable from 10 to 3600 seconds. Cancellation and timeout kill the Linux process group including the mesher/solver. A child monitors its parent so a worker crash does not leave a long CFD process running. Jobs interrupted by worker restart become failed; completed jobs survive. An OS file lock prevents a second worker using the same queue.

The default job root is `.lpbf-jobs/` inside this project and is git-ignored. For regular WSL use, set `METALLIKSA_JOB_ROOT` to a dedicated directory on the Linux filesystem to avoid NTFS/OneDrive I/O overhead; launch the worker with that environment. When the Node bridge starts the WSL worker, a `METALLIKSA_JOB_ROOT` set in the Windows environment must be a drive-letter path; it is forwarded through `WSLENV`, and a Linux or UNC path stops the start with an explicit error (see `docs/APPLICATION_REPRODUCTION.md`). Do not share a job root between separate application instances. Keep archived case files for reproducibility; there is no automatic deletion policy.

Node uses `METALLIKSA_WSL_DISTRO` (default `Ubuntu-22.04`). If WSL cannot start, it launches `py -3` locally. The independent reference thermal solver still works; High-Fidelity remains Screening only. Explicit selection of an unavailable OpenFOAM thermal backend returns a controlled job error. A transient run that boils returns a failed job, never an analytical result disguised as CFD.

### Build the OpenFOAM thermal backend

In WSL, from `Metalliksa-1/python/openfoam`:

```bash
source /opt/openfoam14/etc/bashrc
mkdir -p bin
wmake
```

Start Metalliksa normally with `npm run dev`. The capabilities endpoint must show `openfoamVersion: OpenFOAM-14` and `openfoamThermal: true`. `foamVersion` writes to stderr in the tested installation; detection handles both streams. The compiled binary is local and is not committed. The source, Make configuration and generated case input are reproducible artifacts.

### Modes

- **Quick Screening:** existing Rosenthal and Goldak temperature kernels, constant properties at preheat, no keyhole correction in the engineering comparison. Typical latency is seconds. Old analytical labs and Eagar–Tsai remain available.
- **Standard Simulation:** auto-selects the compiled OpenFOAM thermal solver in WSL; otherwise conservative NumPy reference finite volumes. Usually seconds to minutes; mesh, laser speed, dwell and timestep can make it substantially longer. A 600000-cell / 250000-step budget guards this research implementation.
- **High-Fidelity CFD:** unavailable free-surface capability; explicit analytical screening fallback. It cannot produce a CFD validation badge.
- **Calibration / Validation:** Standard plus measured dimension comparison. Replicates must belong to the submitted process vector. Calibration is never automatically promoted to independent validation.

## Governing model

The stationary control volumes solve

`rho_ref * dh/dt = div(k(T, state) grad T) + Q_laser - boundary losses`.

Specific enthalpy is the integral of piecewise-linear `cp(T)` plus `L * liquidFraction(T)`. The liquid fraction varies linearly between solidus and liquidus. The enthalpy table includes every supplied property knot and both phase boundaries. Enthalpy-to-temperature inversion is monotonic. Pure copper's coincident phase boundaries use an explicitly recorded 1 K numerical regularization around the physical melting point.

Reference mass is fixed on a stationary grid: substrate density is evaluated at preheat; powder mass additionally uses packing fraction. Temperature-dependent density is retained as a constitutive table for diagnostics, but **is not substituted into stored energy without a continuity/moving-mesh equation**. This prevents fictitious energy/mass loss. No thermal expansion, shrinkage or moving solid mass is solved.

Face conductivity is the harmonic mean. Opposite internal face powers cancel exactly. Conductivity increases irreversibly from effective powder to dense material after reaching liquidus; the stationary mass remains conserved. This is a homogenized powder approximation, not a resolved powder packing or densification geometry model.

The 3D Gaussian is `exp(-2*r_xy²/r_beam² - 2*depth²/penetration²)`. Beam diameter means **1/e² intensity diameter**. Penetration equals `layer thickness`, independent of mesh spacing and is an assumption. Discrete cell source powers sum to `absorptivity * laser power` during laser-on intervals. There is no reflection or ray tracing. Powder geometry and attenuation assumptions can strongly affect temperature and depth.

The bottom boundary is held at baseplate preheat with half-cell conduction distance. Side walls are insulated. The current powder surface loses heat by convection and Stefan–Boltzmann radiation to preheat-temperature surroundings. Effective emissivity defaults to **estimated 0.35**. Preheat is prescribed, not computed from an entire build plate.

The grid activates powder layers at scan events, with newly active material at preheat. Meander, unidirectional, stripe and rectangular island tracks support hatch spacing, direction, layer rotation and dwell. Stripe width groups adjacent tracks; meander direction resets within each stripe. Rectangular islands subdivide the along-track extent and group adjacent hatch rows; island columns traverse in alternating order and each sub-track has an explicit dwell. Scanner acceleration and jump travel time are not solved: dwell is supplied. A mesh that cannot activate at least one new cell plane for every layer fails explicitly. The current generator uses a uniform orthogonal mesh; adaptive/local mesh refinement is not implemented.

The explicit timestep is bounded by a conservative 3D Fourier limit, laser motion per step, scan event boundaries and a 25 K sensible-equivalent enthalpy increment. Refinement uses the realized grid spacing and mean used timestep; cap-limited sensitivity runs may be inconclusive.

**Validity stop:** nonfinite enthalpy, temperatures below the enthalpy domain, boiling, energy imbalance over 1%, mesh budget or step budget violation fail the job. Temperature is never clipped to boiling and then reported as a successful solution.

#### Validity envelope of the reference transient (model envelope, 2026-10-04)

Scope: model envelope of the enthalpy-FV reference transient with the homogenised powder layer at these fixed settings; the boiling validity stop is mesh-dependent; not a process window, not experimental validation. Fixed settings are `DEFAULTS` with `mode="standard"`, `backend="reference"`, `evaporationModel=False`: 800 mm/s, 80 µm beam diameter, 80 °C preheat, 40 µm layer, `powder-layer`, 600 µm track. Generated by `python/tools/lpbf_validity_envelope.py`; every case's exact input, wall time, status and metrics are in `docs/LPBF_VALIDITY_ENVELOPE_2026-10-04.json` (Python 3.12.10, numpy 2.2.6, implementation fingerprint `edddf0dc...`).

| Alloy | mesh_um | Highest completed power (W) | First boiling-stop power (W) | Peak cell T at highest completed power (K) | W / D / L at highest completed power (µm) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inconel 718 | 20 | 50 | 60 | 3116 | 80 / 40 / 200 |
| Inconel 718 | 10 | 50 | 60 | 3044 | 80 / 30 / 260 |
| Ti-6Al-4V | 20 | 30 | 40 | 3152 | 80 / 20 / 200 |
| 316L Stainless Steel | 20 | 40 | 60 | 2933 | 80 / 20 / 220 |
| AlSi10Mg | 20 | 200 (sweep ceiling) | none up to 200 | 2505 | 160 / 60 / 220 |

Sweep grid: 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 200 W at 20 µm for all four alloys; 40, 60, 80, 100 W at 10 µm for Inconel 718 only; a series stops after two consecutive boiling stops (higher powers were then recorded as not run, not as failures). Three supplementary points outside that grid were added to resolve the table: Inconel 718 at 50 W / 20 µm, Inconel 718 at 50 W / 10 µm, and Ti-6Al-4V at 20 and 30 W / 20 µm (Ti-6Al-4V already stops at the 40 W grid floor), which is four runs in total. No case exceeded the 15-minute budget; the 10 µm Inconel 718 cases took about 307 s (40 W) and 494 s (50 W, run while the machine was also busy with other work, so that figure is an upper bound on a quiet machine).

The peak cell temperature is demonstrably mesh-dependent (below), and the boiling stop depends on the peak cell temperature, so a stop or a pass at one `mesh_um` is not converged evidence. Observed in this sweep: the first boiling stop is 60 W at both 20 µm and 10 µm for Inconel 718, with 50 W completing at both meshes (peak 3116 K at 20 µm, 7 K below the 3123.15 K limit; 3044 K at 10 µm, 79 K below it). So no shift of the 50/60 W bracket between the two meshes was observed here; a shift of the stop power with mesh is inferred from the peak-temperature dependence for powers between the 10 W grid points (for example 55 W was not run), not observed. The audit measured (not re-run here) for the V1-like 60 W / 1200 mm/s / 200 °C / 20 µm IN718 powder case that refining the mesh from 20 to 10 µm changes depth from 40 to 30 µm, the thermal gradient G from 1.96e7 to 9.1e6 K/m and the cooling rate from 1.73e6 to 6.6e5 K/s (`AUDIT-engines-lpbf-fable.md` §2.4), and the independent refinement study in §2.1 shows peak T rising 3644 → 4677 → 5306 K from 20 to 5 µm cells while the geometry converges. §2.1 is a synthetic constant-property bare-plate case with 5 µm penetration, not IN718 powder. Mesh dependence also appears in this envelope, but in the opposite direction: the Inconel 718 40 W peak falls from 2804.0 K at 20 µm to 2617.4 K at 10 µm (and the 50 W peak from 3116.0 K to 3044.1 K). The sign of the mesh error is therefore case-dependent.

W, D and L in the table are whole multiples of the mesh spacing (at 20 µm the depth is 1-2 cells, and W = 80 µm is 4 cells, equal to the beam diameter), so they are cell-quantised, not converged lengths. The thermal gradient G halves between the two meshes (Inconel 718 40 W: 2.04e7 K/m at 20 µm, 1.04e7 K/m at 10 µm) and the cooling rate drops from 8.6e5 to 6.7e5 K/s. These quantities feed microstructure estimates and carry roughly a factor-2 mesh uncertainty.

For homogenised Inconel 718 powder at 20 µm the last completed run is 50 W at 800 mm/s, a linear energy density P/v of 62.5 J/m (peak 3116 K, 7 K below the 3123.15 K boiling limit); 60 W (75 J/m) stops. The reference transient is therefore usable only below roughly 62-75 J/m (the completed/stopped bracket) for this powder model and settings, far below industrial energy densities (for example NIST AMB2022-03 Inconel 718 at 285 W / 960 mm/s is about 297 J/m, versus 62.5 J/m for the last completed 50 W / 800 mm/s case at 20 µm); this is a limit of the homogenised-powder reference model (volumetric source over the layer, no evaporative cooling and no melt-pool flow; a 20 W/m²K film and top-surface radiation are included), not a statement about any process.

## Outputs and definitions

- Length/width/depth, volume and maximum YZ cross-sectional area are extracted from `T >= liquidus`. Geometry is reported at the earliest maximum molten-cell volume over every accepted timestep. Playback remains sampled at approximately 60 instants. Peak time, step and playback volume loss are reported in numericalDiagnostics; these do not bound timestep/mesh error. Length/width are rotated into scan coordinates. The YZ area is a grid-plane area, not a scan-normal area for rotated scans.
- Extents include all concurrently molten cells. Multiple disconnected pools are not reported as a resolved single-track contour. For multiple tracks, LoF/balling/keyhole heuristics based on aggregate width are disabled and overlap is unavailable. Remelting counts cells that cross liquidus again after cooling, divided by ever-melted cells. It is a volume fraction on this uniform grid, not an experimental bonding fraction.
- Peak temperature is tracked every step. `G=|grad T|`, `R=-(dT/dt)/G` and cooling rate are evaluated on cooling liquidus crossings. Reported means are crossing-event weighted; `mean(G)*mean(R)` need not equal `mean(GR)`.
- Marangoni number uses the temperature-dependent viscosity table, `|dγ/dT|`, temperature excess and pool width. Thermal Peclet uses laser translation speed, not a computed liquid velocity. These numbers do **not** establish resolved Marangoni flow.
- Keyhole depth and recoil pressure are **null** because no free surface or evaporation is solved. No porosity probability, cracking risk, residual stress or distortion is inferred from the thermal calculation.
- The reference backend writes `peak-field.npz`; OpenFOAM writes it plus `openfoam-case/coordinates.csv`, `snapshots.dat` and `peak-state.dat` (peak time, surface, step, molten count, then temperatures; zero-melt output contains only four zeros). The shared NPZ includes the active mask and step-specific surface/scan angle. Snapshot rows contain `time, inputEnergy, lostEnergy, storedEnergy, minimumDt, steps, surfaceZ, peakT, sumG, sumR, sumCooling, frontCount, everMeltedCount, remeltedCount`, then cell temperatures in coordinate-file order. Coordinates include cell volume. Retain these files for subsequent thermal/mechanical coupling. Peak-temperature history JSON alone is insufficient for a full stress analysis.

## Material evidence

There are 15 explicit alloy identities. Eight have inherited solid/liquid endpoint data: Ti-6Al-4V, 316L, AlSi10Mg, IN718, CoCrMo, Scalmalloy, Hastelloy X and pure copper. These are marked **estimated** because this change does not independently verify their individual endpoint sources. Piecewise interpolation is an estimated law; viscosity remains constant where the legacy database provides one value.

IN625, 17-4PH, 15-5PH, 18Ni300, AlSi7Mg, CuCrZr and Ti-5553 require supplied data. They are registered identities with a data gap, **not seven newly validated material models**. No unknown alloy is silently replaced with IN718 in the new pipeline.

Supply a JSON object with:

```json
{
  "source": "Resolvable publication DOI / measured dataset and conditions",
  "solidus_K": 1533.15,
  "liquidus_K": 1609.15,
  "boiling_K": 3123.15,
  "latentHeat_J_kg": 270000,
  "absorptivity": 0.38,
  "emissivity": 0.35,
  "dGamma_dT": -0.0004,
  "table": [
    [273.15, 8190, 11.4, 435, 0.0055],
    [1609.15, 7450, 29, 730, 0.0055],
    [3123.15, 7450, 29, 730, 0.0055]
  ]
}
```

This example repeats **estimated legacy IN718 data to illustrate the schema**; it is not measured evidence and must not be relabelled for another alloy. Table columns are `T_K, rho_kg_m3, k_W_mK, cp_J_kgK, viscosity_Pa_s`. Tables must cover 273.15 K through boiling, be finite/positive and have strictly increasing temperature. User-supplied data remains unverified even with a source string.

## Verification and calibration

Every result records requested/effective modes, actual solver identity, OpenFOAM version, binary hash, implementation/input hashes, normalized settings, material evidence and assumptions. Cache identity includes inputs, properties, Python/C++ implementation and worker/binary capability. Failed, cancelled and timed-out results are never cached as successes.

Energy audit compares absorbed laser energy against stored enthalpy and integrated boundary losses. Machine-precision closure is necessary but **does not establish spatial accuracy**: a conservative coarse grid can still give very wrong dimensions. Domain-size independence, sampling convergence and powder/absorption uncertainty remain additional studies.

Three-level mesh/timestep studies report observed order and 1.25-factor GCI only for positive, monotone results with an approximately constant realized refinement ratio. Oscillations, identical voxel dimensions, cap-limited timestep ratios and non-asymptotic behavior are reported as **inconclusive**. No test automatically assigns “mesh independent”.

Measured widths/depths produce signed percentage errors, RMSE, signed bias and `sum(predicted*measured)/sum(predicted²)` as a dimension multiplier. If every prediction is zero, the factor is null and errors remain -100%. Factors are not absorptivity fits and are not silently applied. A held-out independent dataset, uncertainty intervals, matching beam definitions and measurement locations are still required for validation.

Tests:

```text
npm run lint
npm run build
py -3 python/test_lpbf_engineering.py
python3 python/test_lpbf_engineering.py        # WSL, includes real OpenFOAM comparison
py -3 python/test_lpbf_api.py                 # server running on localhost:3000
npm run test:meltpool
```

The reference/OpenFOAM verification fixture uses estimated IN718, 40 W, 800 mm/s, 80 µm beam, 80 °C preheat, 40 µm layer, 100 µm hatch, a 200 µm track, nominal 40 µm mesh and 1 µs max timestep. It is intentionally a low-power numerical fixture, not an industrial process prescription or an experimental benchmark.

## Scientific basis and remaining high-fidelity work

- [OpenFOAM Foundation 14 release](https://openfoam.org/version/14/) — backend identity and solver framework; this project compiles against the actual installed Foundation 14 headers.
- [Voller and Prakash, enthalpy methodology](https://doi.org/10.1016/0017-9310(87)90317-6) — latent heat/enthalpy basis. This implementation does not yet include their momentum sink coupling.
- [Goldak et al., finite element heat source](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02667333) — retained analytical screening source model, not a validation of this LPBF case.
- [NIST AM model validation metrology](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/metrology-multi-physics-am-model-validation) and [NIST model uncertainty](https://www.nist.gov/publications/identifying-uncertainty-laser-powder-bed-fusion-models) — separate numerical verification, experimental validation and uncertainty evidence.
- [NIST keyhole/melt-pool benchmark](https://www.nist.gov/publications/benchmark-study-melt-pool-and-keyhole-dynamics-laser-absorption-and-porosity-additive) — a prospective validation target; no claim that this thermal solver reproduces it.

The user-requested end goal remains open: a tested metal/gas VOF solver with mass/momentum/enthalpy conservation, capillary curvature, temperature/composition-dependent Marangoni stress, enthalpy-porosity solid drag, evaporation mass/energy removal, recoil coupling, optical absorption/reflections, bounded interface transport and capillary/Courant timestep control. It then needs interface/spurious-current tests, evaporation energy/mass audits, free-surface benchmark comparisons, domain/mesh/timestep studies and independent experimental LPBF validation. None of these can be replaced by a thermal heat map or a status badge.


## September 12 reliability and evidence update

See [architecture audit](LPBF_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md) and [reproducible numerical benchmark](LPBF_BENCHMARK_2026-09-12.json). Source placement is evaluated at step start consistently with first-order explicit Euler; source-driven timestep limiting cannot move it to the wrong midpoint. The OpenFOAM surface-loss mask selects only the highest active cell plane. Rotated extents include the projected cube support. Gaussian depth remains an assumed absorption distribution, not an optical solution.

Mass audit reports initial active reference mass, newly activated powder reference mass, and final reference mass. It does not claim continuity or evaporation conservation. Phase audit partitions active volume into enthalpy liquid/solid fractions; the metal/gas interface conservation value remains null. Temperature and enthalpy liquid-fraction X–Z previews come directly from the saved peak-volume field on the nearest y=0 plane. They are separate from analytical 3D geometry. Analytical cavity cones, trapped-pore spheres and uncomputed reflection paths are removed. The Fabbro model remains available as a screening depth proxy.

The queue distinguishes a completed cache hit from joining a queued/running job. Cached artifacts are checked for existence, size and SHA-256 before reuse. A corrupt cached job becomes failed and a fresh job is created. Result manifests include relative paths, byte sizes and checksums. Fields remain in files; SVG previews and thermal-history CSV are served through a fixed allowlist and checksum verification. Retention is explicit operator deletion; there is no automatic expiry. UI polling preserves cache status, stops on terminal states and slows when hidden. Local storage retains job ID, cache state and input signature for refresh recovery; restored results are labelled as belonging to saved settings.

`POST /api/lpbf/estimate` validates the input and reports uniform cell count, spacing, simulated duration, approximate working-array memory, estimated steps and solve count. It does not claim calibrated wall time or an HPC scheduler estimate. Optical emissivity and absorptivity overrides are finite and bounded.

Measurements accept required `width_um`, `depth_um`, `source`, plus optional `processVector`, `uncertainty_um` (nonnegative width/depth uncertainty in µm), and boolean `independentHoldout`. The exact process-vector keys are defined in `python/lpbf_evidence.py:PROCESS_KEYS`; values must match normalized result settings, including effective optical properties and thermal-history controls. Unknown fields and mismatching vectors fail. When a vector is missing, signed errors/RMSE/bias are descriptive only and calibration factors are null. User-declared holdout and source strings never establish experimental validation.

Additional controls: `stripeWidth_um` in [20,3000], `islandSize_um` in [50,3000], `emissivity` in [0,1]. The 15-identity registry retains eight estimated data models and seven explicit missing-data identities. Supplied material metadata is unverified, rejects unknown fields and reports temperature coverage and unquantified uncertainty.

Repeatable checks: `npx tsx tests/lpbf-contract.test.ts`; `npx tsx tests/lpbf-smoke-server.ts` starts an isolated engineering API/UI host on 127.0.0.1:3001. Set `METALLIKSA_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/lpbf` for API tests. The smoke host intentionally excludes unrelated legacy physics endpoints, so their requests may show 404; use the full application for their integration checks. Run `python3 python/benchmark_lpbf_engineering.py --output docs/LPBF_BENCHMARK_2026-09-12.json` in WSL for backend benchmarks. Synthetic measurement fixtures are always labelled as tests, not evidence.

Remaining research gates: bounded metal/gas transport, capillary and Marangoni momentum, evaporation/recoil, keyhole collapse, local track fusion metrics, adaptive refinement, full field-history mechanics coupling, material-source verification, and independent experimental validation. None is implied by the conservation audits or engineering visual style.


## Resolved 3D field explorer
Both thermal backends export full sampled cell temperatures as separate little-endian float32 files (`field-frame-NNN.bin`), cell centers (`field-coordinates.bin`) and a small `field-series.json` index. These are visualization artifacts; solver calculations and metrics retain float64 precision. Every artifact is recorded by size/SHA-256 and checked before serving. The maximum field is 600,000 cells; a temperature frame is at most 2.4 MB and coordinates 7.2 MB, below the 8 MB endpoint limit. Samples are capped at 128 frames. No fields are embedded in the result JSON.

The viewer loads one frame at a time, can play sampled time, orbit/zoom, cut along Y, and filter mushy/liquid cells. Temperature uses one fixed color range across the run. Liquid fraction is computed from the same solidus/liquidus enthalpy phase interval and deposition height; it is not metal/gas VOF. Up to 50,000 cell cubes are displayed; larger domains explicitly sample every nth cell without changing numerical metrics. Display gaps are not pores. Full artifacts remain available locally. Raw fields have no velocity or keyhole geometry.

Limits: uniform mesh, sampled temporal output, float32 visualization precision, approximate memory estimate, no calibrated wall-clock forecast. The benchmark multi-layer/island fixtures do not melt and only verify thermal accumulation. Free-surface, fluid flow, evaporation, recoil, pore trapping and mechanics remain unresolved. Experimental validation remains pending.


## 2026-09-13 result integrity and scientific display

Inactive future-layer cells are excluded from cooling-front gradients in both backends. Active face differences are averaged per axis, giving centered differences internally and one-sided differences at the active-domain boundary. This is an extraction correction; thermal energy and liquidus-cell dimensions remain unchanged for the verification fixture.

Every thermal result must supply energy, stationary mass and enthalpy phase-volume accounting. Publication and restoration recompute closure (energy <=1%; mass and phase partition <=1e-10 relative error) and reject nonfinite/negative accounting and unbounded phase fractions. These strict algebraic bookkeeping checks are not CFD mass conservation or experimental validation. Failed saved results become failed jobs; the frontend also refuses failed closure.

Field-series frames optionally contain backend-derived projected molten-cell bounds and scan angle. They support current-snapshot L/W/D guides; the header reports the largest accepted-step molten volume. The viewer reconstructs a liquidus section by linear interpolation on triangles joining the nearest section's cell centers. This is a temperature isotherm, not a metal/gas surface. Rendering uses exact-size cell cubes, a translucent mushy zone and the same fixed color mapping as the legend. Large fields retain explicit display sampling; the section contour uses all section cells. No sub-cell geometric accuracy is claimed by the smoother contour. Peak-volume time and all-step peak-temperature time can differ and are labelled separately.

The reconstructed section is in mesh X-Z, Y-Z or top coordinates, while dimension guides use the actual layer's scan orientation. Source/checksum disclosure is available inside the viewer. The thermal-history current-time marker follows successfully loaded snapshots. Laser-on, dwell/inter-track and final-cooling context are derived from the saved scan schedule; scanner travel itself is unresolved.

See `LPBF_BENCHMARK_2026-09-13.json` for the latest reproducible numerical fixtures. Surface-tension, fluid Marangoni and evaporation/recoil tests remain unavailable because those equations are not implemented. Existing analytical Marangoni/Fabbro tests exercise screening only. The phase-change tests verify the enthalpy integral and inversion, not an independent Stefan-interface experiment.
