MetalliX CALPHAD multi-component Gibbs free energy minimisation (pycalphad)

pycalphad is REQUIRED. The solver never substitutes a non-thermodynamic model: when
pycalphad is not installed, when a requested element is absent from the selected
database, when the selected database is a pycalphad test fixture, or when the
equilibrium calculation fails, it returns success false with status "unavailable",
an unavailableKind and a reason (exit code 0; the request itself was well formed).
The former empirical "sub-regular" fallback (wt%-linear liquidus correlations,
sqrt/power-law phase fractions, ln gamma = -0.45 (1 - x), reported with
isEmpirical false) was removed: it was not a Gibbs minimisation and failed the
Gibbs-Duhem relation.

What a successful pycalphad run computes:
 1. Gibbs free energy minimisation (pycalphad equilibrium, compound-energy formalism)
    on a temperature grid at fixed composition and 1 atm.
 2. Chemical potentials (MU, database SER scale) and activities a_i = exp((mu_i - G_i_ref(T)) / RT)
    against pure i in its SER reference phase at the same T (activityReferenceStates).
 3. Phase constitution (phase names, fractions, phase compositions) per temperature.
 4. New-PHACOMP Nv / Md screening (Ni-base only, tabulated values; unavailable otherwise).
 5. Liquidus / solidus refined between grid points by multi-section equilibria.
 6. A stepwise Scheil-Gulliver solidification path (pycalphad equilibria of the remaining
    liquid; scheil_gulliver) and, from it, partition coefficients k of the primary solid
    phase at its first appearance. Labelled unvalidated, with its validity range.

Every field that cannot be computed is null with a status and a reason (see
criticalTemperatureStatus, scheilSolidification, solutePartitioning[].reason):
 - gamma-prime solvus: unavailable, the L1_2 model phase also describes the
   disordered gamma and no site-fraction ordering check exists;
 - beta transus / sigma: flagged phase-name heuristics on the grid.

Speed: parsed databases and compiled pycalphad models (Workspace) are cached per process by
calphad_model_cache (key: database SHA-256, components, phases, condition keys). In the IPC
service calphad requests run in one dedicated worker (persistent_ipc_service
AFFINITY_SCRIPT_NAMES), so repeated requests for a system are warm. Each result reports
modelCache.status ("cold" / "warm") and timingsMs.

Databases: python/databases holds pycalphad test files next to a few real
assessments. Test fixtures (file header or catalogue flag) are refused; the catalogue
marks each entry as "assessment" or "test-fixture".

    """Scheil-Gulliver solidification path (no diffusion in the solid, complete mixing in the liquid).

    Classic stepwise algorithm: at each temperature step the current liquid (composition x_L) is
    equilibrated; the solid that forms is removed from the system, the liquid fraction is
    multiplied by the local liquid fraction and x_L becomes the composition of the equilibrium
    liquid. ``run_point(T_C, x_liquid)`` returns {"liquid": f, "liquidX": {...},
    "phases": {name: amount}} for one equilibrium, or None when it did not converge.

    Fractions are on the pycalphad basis (moles of atoms). The path stops when the liquid
    fraction falls below SCHEIL_LIQUID_STOP, when the liquid disappears inside one step (an
    invariant reaction or the step skipped the end of solidification: the terminal temperature
    is then known to within that step), when a point does not converge, at the step or time
    limit, or at the lowest temperature. Every stop is reported with its reason; nothing is
    extrapolated. Pure function of ``run_point``: testable without pycalphad.

    Until the first solid has formed next to remaining liquid, a step that freezes the whole liquid
    is retried with half the step (down to SCHEIL_MIN_STEP_C); after a resolved step the step grows
    back towards ``step_c`` by doubling. If even the minimum step freezes everything, the solid that
    formed is recorded as the first phase without a tie-line (``firstStepUnresolved``).

    ``steps`` counts every equilibrium call, including the ``stepBisections`` retries that were
    discarded; ``pathSteps`` is the number of resolved path points after the start (len(points) - 1).
    ``clampedSteps`` counts equilibrium calls too.
